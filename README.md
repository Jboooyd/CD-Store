CD-Store  
======== `Due Date: Sunday September 9th by 11:55 pm`

GUI interface for a fictional CD store.

Description
-----------

Develop a Java program that creates a standalone GUI application (not an applet) that
simulates an e-store which allows the user to add items (music CDs) to a shopping cart and once all
items are included, total all costs (including tax) and produce an invoice.

### Input Specification

The file “inventory.txt” as described above (see example below as
well).

### Output Specification

Output is to appear in the specified components of the GUI and various
message boxes that appear, plus the contents of the
“transactions.txt” log file that will be generated. Note (see top of
page 4) that a discount is applied when the user purchases large quantities
of a single disc.
